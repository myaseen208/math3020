## Statistics: The Science of Learning from Data

::: {.columns style="gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Statistics Definition:**

Deals with the **collection**, **presentation**, **analysis**, and use of **data** to:

- **Make decisions**
- **Solve problems**
- **Design products and processes**

Statistical techniques are useful for describing and understanding **variability**.
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
**Variability in Engineering:**

By **variability**, we mean successive observations of a system or phenomenon do not produce exactly the same result.

**Statistics** gives us a framework for:

- Describing this **variability**
- Learning about potential **sources of variability**
- Making decisions despite uncertainty

# Key Definitions and Concepts

## Population vs. Sample

::: {.columns style="gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Population**

- **Set** of measurements of interest
- Characteristics of the population (**parameters**) are typically of interest
- Usually unknown and must be estimated

**Sample**

- **Subset** of measurements of interest
- A characteristic of the **sample** (**statistic**) is used to **infer population characteristics** (**parameters**)
- Observable and computable
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
**Parameter**

- A **characteristic** of the **population** (usually unknown and estimated from sample data)
- Examples: μ, σ, π

**Statistic**

- A **characteristic** of the **sample** (computed from observed data)
- Examples: x̄ ,s ,p


:::
:::

## Types of Statistical Analysis

::: {.columns style="gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Descriptive Statistics**

- **Describing** the important **characteristics** of a set of data
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of variability (standard deviation, range)
- Graphical displays (histograms, box plots)
- Summary tables and charts
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
**Inferential Statistics**

- Using **sample data** to make **inferences** (or **generalizations**) about a **population**

# O-Ring Development Example

---

## Population vs. Sample in Practice

::: {.callout-note}
## Example: O-Ring Development for Semiconductor Equipment

**Engineering Context:** An engineer is developing a rubber compound for use in O-rings. The O-rings are to be employed as seals in plasma etching tools used in the semiconductor industry, so their resistance to acids and other corrosive substances is an important characteristic.

The engineer uses the standard rubber compound to produce eight O-rings in a development laboratory and measures the tensile strength of each specimen after immersion in a nitric acid solution at 30°C for 25 minutes.
:::

**Data:** The tensile strengths (in psi) of the eight O-rings are:
1030, 1035, 1020, 1049, 1028, 1026, 1019, and 1010

## Analysis of O-Ring Data

::: {.columns style="gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Statistical Components:**

- **Population:** All possible O-rings made with this rubber compound
- **Sample:** The eight O-rings tested (n = 8)
- **Parameter:** True mean tensile strength (μ) of all O-rings
- **Statistic:** Sample mean tensile strength (x̄ = 1027.1 psi)
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
**Key Observation:**

As we should have anticipated, not all the O-ring specimens exhibit the same measurement of tensile strength.

This demonstrates the fundamental concept of **variability** in engineering measurements.
:::
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Engineering Insight
The variation in tensile strength is not a measurement error - it's real variability that must be understood and managed in the engineering design process.
:::

---

# Random Variables and Variability

---

## Understanding Random Variables

::: {.columns style="gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Random Variable Concept:**

Since tensile strength **varies** or exhibits **variability**, it is a **random variable**.

A **random variable** X can be modeled by:

$$X = \mu + \epsilon$$

where μ is a constant and ε is a random disturbance, or "noise" term.
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
**Sources of Variability:**

- **Common Causes:** Natural variation inherent in the process
- **Special Causes:** Unusual events that create additional variation
- **Measurement Error:** Variation due to measurement system
- **Environmental Factors:** Temperature, humidity, vibration effects
:::
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Engineering Application
Understanding sources of variability helps engineers design more robust processes and make better decisions under uncertainty.
